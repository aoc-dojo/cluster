# Setting up the cluster

This folder has resources required for setting up new the cluster from scratch:
* Azure ARM templates to create the AKS instance
* Scripts to setup Flux

Once AKS and Flux are setup, all other changes will go through the folders in the rest of the repository, which define state for Flux.
